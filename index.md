Welcome to GitBasics. You can learn the basics of Git here.

Git is a version control system that has transformed the way people write code. 
However, this is not to say that Git is useful only if you write code.
In principle, Git can be used for version-controlling of any kind of file.
In practice, Git works best for files that are in plain-text, such as source code, markdown documents, and Latex documents.

This tutorial is an attempt to get you started with Git in a simple way.
Head over to our blog tutorials to start learning.
